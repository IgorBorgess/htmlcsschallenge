    <h4 class="description">When plague ravages a region, a spirit will sometimes walk
        its lands, a ghost resembling an ill person whose flesh rots off
        its bones and in whose wake crawls a cavalcade of rats and
        vermines. No one knows whether this spirit brings the pox
        with it or is merely drawn to it like a moth to a light. Yet it is
        certain that it delights in dealing pain and suffering, in
        hearing the howling and moaning of men.</h4>

    <p class="bold">Subtle Influence:</p>
    <p class="description">Many have called into question the very
        existence of pestae. Only two confirmed sightings of such a
        creature have ever been recorded, both during times of raging
        epidemic. The truth is that the work of a pesta can most of
        the time be attributed to natural causes. It's very difficult to
        assert with certainty the presence of the creature and only
        the most knowledgeable of scholars, wraith-hunters and
        apothecaries can detect its work.</p>

    <hr>

    <p class="bold">Deceitful Spirit:</p>
    <p class="description">Some suggest that pestae can pass for
        other type of ghost or wraith, hiding their presence and true
        identity on purpose. As the name “pesta” suggests, these
        wraiths take the appearance of plague victims, dressed in a
        tattered shroud crawling with vermin and surrounded by a
        cloud of flies. Most scholar speculate they, like other such
        wraiths, arise from the powerful emotional charge associated
        with certain circumstances of death, such as death preceded
        by a long and particularly painful illness. To the difference of
        many other spirits, pestae are not bound to a location and can
        travel great distances, they go were epidemics spread or
        move to new regions to start them, which of the two is
        uncertain.</p>

        <hr>

    <p class="bold">Patient Work:</p>
    <p class="description">Pestae are certainly among the most vicious
        of wraith, intentionally hiding their presence and laying the
        foundation of their grand work with care. Most seek a
        believable source of natural or magical epidemic, such as an
        apothecary working in the hospital of a crowded districts or a
        wizard studying magical diseases. Once it found its chosen
        one, it influences him or her with suggestive visions and
        whispered advices, guiding them toward the discovery or
        creation of a new affliction. Following these revelations these
        individuals often become the head of a plague-cult, furthering
        the epidemy ’spread. Pestae are also known to consort with
        other undead, such as garkains, rotfiends and other monsters
        thriving on diseases.</p>

        <hr>

        <p class="bold">Feverish Worship:</p>
        <p class="description">Those afflicted by the supernatural
        disease of a pesta will sometime experience fever induced
        visions, showing them a figure floating over them. In some
        regions raging with epidemics, plague cults have spread,
        actively exposing members to the disease to receive the
        "feverish blessing". In some rare cases some of these
        individuals are living in an inexplicable state of harmony with
        a devouring cancer, wrapping their body with scabs and boils
        but somehow keeping them alive, sometime long after their
        life expectancy.</p>

        <h2>Regional Effects</h2>
        <p class="description">The region containing a pesta suffers of the creature's insidious presence, creating the following magical effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using natural and magical healing is a difficult thing in the
                region, if not impossible.</li>
            <li>Epidemics start to spread quickly in the region. Everyone
                in the region have disadvantage and incubation time is reduced by half.</li>
            <li>Vermins, especially rats and flies, start to converge toward
                the region and show signs of unusual swarm behavior and
                increased aggressiveness. These swarms are always
                carrying diseases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="description">When the pesta is destroyed, all of these regional effects fade over 10 days.</p>
